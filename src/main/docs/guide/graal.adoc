https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM] is a new universal virtual machine from Oracle that supports a polyglot runtime
 environment and the ability to compile Java applications down to native machine code.

Any Micronaut application can be run using the GraalVM JVM, however special support has been added to Micronaut to
 support running Micronaut applications using
 https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/[GraalVM's `native-image` tool].

NOTE: Use of GraalVM's `native-image` tool is only supported in Java or Kotlin projects. Groovy relies heavily on
reflection which is only partially supported by GraalVM.
